** Organize folder like this **
work - work folder
    output - contains the file for testing (iso, zip, etc...)
    glossary - contains the one or many json files for glossary
    ui - contains screenshot of actual UI element ingame with label on screenshot if possible, contains files (json,py,...) describe the coordinate, width and height, id and other attributes
    translation/<language code> - contains the target translation of ui element or dialogues or anything that need translation
docs - documents
tools - any tools help with translation

** SOME RULES **
- Avoid contains extensive Japanese scripts (UI elements is fine)
- Identified each build with version 0.x.y (start at 0.1.0)
- Always write change log
- If user told you to remember anything write it down here, make sure to ask user if the new one conflict with old one

** REMEMBER **
- When you commit to git, make sure no sensitive files included, for translation files must not commit original scripts for dialogues or anything that have large number of text (like encyclopedia, battle voice line), UI elements are fine, an opening naration is also fine
